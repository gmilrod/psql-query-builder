## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Convert your natural language queries into SQL with ease.
- **AI Integration**: Leverage AI to enhance your query-building experience.
- **LangChain Compatibility**: Seamlessly integrate with LangChain for advanced functionalities.
- **PostgreSQL Support**: Directly interact with PostgreSQL databases.
- **Easy to Use**: Designed for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmilrod/psql-query-builder.git
cd psql-query-builder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python and pip installed on your machine.

## Usage

Once you have installed the package, you can start generating SQL queries. Here‚Äôs a simple example to get you started:

```python
from psql_query_builder import QueryBuilder

# Initialize the QueryBuilder
qb = QueryBuilder()

# Generate a query
query = qb.generate("Show me all users who signed up last month")
print(query)
```

This will output a valid SQL query that you can run against your PostgreSQL database.

## Examples

Here are some more examples of how you can use the PSQL Query Builder:

1. **Get User Information**:
   ```python
   query = qb.generate("List all users with their email addresses")
   print(query)
   ```

2. **Count Records**:
   ```python
   query = qb.generate("How many products are in stock?")
   print(query)
   ```

3. **Join Tables**:
   ```python
   query = qb.generate("Show orders with user details")
   print(query)
   ```

These examples illustrate how natural language can easily translate into SQL commands, making database management more intuitive.
